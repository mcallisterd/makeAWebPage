      The uniform distribution is assumed by continuous variables which have equal probability of falling in any range within its possible range.
      For example, if you were throwing a dart in front of you with random force and we measured the distance from you that the dart landed, that
      distance would be a uniform random variable over the interval (minimum throw distance, maximum throw distance).
      <br/> On a more technical note, the picture above the pdf of a uniform random variable defined on (a,b). The height is 1/(b-a) because
      the area under the curve must be 1. The cdf of a uniform random variable is zero from negative infinity to a, and then a line with slope one and x intercept a.
