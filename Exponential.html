      The exponential distribution is used to model how likely an event is
       to happen within some time frame. One interesting property of some
       is the memoryless property. This property means that, as long as the time
       period is equal in length, the probability of an event happening is the
       same. So if 1 car on average went by through an intersection, if you
       know how long you have been waiting, you can know how long you would
       need to wait to see a car.
